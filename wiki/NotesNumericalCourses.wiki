Does MINRES-QLP works in Octave?


= Details =

It does!  We have tested it using GNU Octave, version 3.2.4 on the operating system x86_64 GNU/Linux. We ran the following example in Octave:
{{{
cd Algorithms/MINRESQLP/
n = 100;                                  e = ones(n,1);
A = spdiags([-2*e 4*e -2*e],-1:1,n,n);    M = spdiags(4*e,0,n,n);
b = sum(A,2);             rtol = 1e-10;   maxit = 50;
x = minresQLP(A,b,rtol,maxit,M);
norm(A*x-b)
ans =  1.7093e-14

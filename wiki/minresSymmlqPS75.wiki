#A question about MINRES and SYMMLQ.

= Question =

I read your paper about MINRES-QLP. But I have some questions.  Since I don't understand MINRES and SYMMLQ very well thus there are some difficulties to understand your paper. When I read the paper "Solution of Sparse Indefinite Systems of Linear Equations" by C. C. Paige and M. A. Saunders. I was a little confused about the structure and the explanations.  Can you recommend some other papers that focus on MINRES and SYMMLQ?

The 1975 paper is not an easy one to understand and Choi's thesis (http://bit.ly/Nl6XI7) could be considered an attempt to demystify some of the key ideas. The book by Van der Vorst (http://bit.ly/Nl6N3n) is a good one as well.

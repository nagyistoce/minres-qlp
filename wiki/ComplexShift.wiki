#Summary: A Hermitian problem with a complex shift is a non-Hermitian problem.

= Question =

I am a postdoc at [...] university, working on some computational
chemistry methods, and come across your MINRES-QLP documentation. The
algorithm seems exactly what I need for solving some near-singular
Hermitian linear systems, with complex offset.

By complex offset, I meant that the shift input (sigma) of the matrix A is a complex number, with a small, but non-zero imaginary component. Since the variable is a complex number, I presume that it can handle this case? I have set the code up, and interfaced it with mine. I must remark that the code looks as though it is fantastically written and well documented - many thanks! Linking it into my code and getting it working was no trouble. 


The algorithm generally gets stuck, and hits the iteration limit...
 
= Answer =

Given A Hermitian, shift has to be real for (A-shift) I to remain Hermitian.  It is unfortunate that the version-20 Fortran-90 implementation for shift is not type safe.  We have been working to produce a new version that include numerous other minor updates to make the code and documentation more polished.



If the original problem is not too ill conditioned, then in Matlab notation, the normal equation is a workaround (eye is identity, s is shift):

  x=minresqlp((A-s*eye(n))'*(A-s*eye(n)), (A-s*eye(n))'*b)

#summary MINRES-QLP into python.

= Question =

I'm interested in using MINRES-QLP to solve linear equations as part of a truncated Newton-like algorithm (instead of the classical linear CG). This is for research purposes; I'm a PhD student at [â€¦].  I'm interested in knowing what is the license of MINRES-QLP? Can I translate it into Python?  Can I have this translated code with a BSD license? 


= Answer =

You are certainly welcome to translate MINRES-QLP into Python. A BSD license is fine.  References in your Python code to our SISC and ACM TOMS papers is not necessary but will be appreciated for documentation purpose.

When the python translation is created, we would be glad to add it to our project website for MINRES-QLP and list you as a contributor.
